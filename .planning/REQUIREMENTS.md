# Requirements: NBA AI System

## Data Maximization Principle
Every phase must extract the maximum possible data from available sources. NBA API data (no video needed) should be scraped exhaustively before building models. CV tracking data enhances models but does not gate them.

---

## Phase 1 Requirements — Data Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE

- REQ-01: PostgreSQL schema with tables: games, players, teams, tracking_frames, possessions, shots, lineups, odds, predictions
- REQ-02: schedule_context.py returns rest days, back-to-back flag, travel distance (miles)
- REQ-03: nba_stats.py fetches opponent defensive rating, pace, eFG% allowed

---

## Phase 2 Requirements — Critical Tracker Bug Fixes

- REQ-02A: Team color classification separates players into two distinct teams (team_a / team_b) — NOT all-green. Both teams present in team column of every game output.
- REQ-02B: EventDetector fires shot events — at least 1 shot detected per minute of broadcast footage

- REQ-02E: Clip duration validator rejects clips under 60 seconds as insufficient for analytics
- REQ-02F: All 17 existing clips re-processed through fixed tracker; output validated (non-zero shots, both teams present)
