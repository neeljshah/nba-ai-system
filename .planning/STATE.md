# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-09)

**Core value:** Raw video goes in, betting-relevant predictions come out — every layer (tracking → features → models → conversational AI) wired together and working.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — CV Pipeline + Storage

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (CV Pipeline + Storage)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-09 — Roadmap created, phases 1-6 defined

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 25%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack locked: YOLOv8, DeepSORT, PostgreSQL, Streamlit, Plotly, FastAPI, Claude API
- Heavy ML training offloaded to cloud; local GPU used for inference and dev iteration
- Each module must be independently testable
- [Phase 01-cv-pipeline-storage]: Used psycopg2-binary (not psycopg2) to avoid requiring libpq headers on host
- [Phase 01-cv-pipeline-storage]: UUID PKs via gen_random_uuid() (pgcrypto), composite index on tracking_coordinates(game_id, frame_number)
- [Phase 01-cv-pipeline-storage]: Schema-as-SQL pattern: DDL in schema.sql, init_schema() reads and executes idempotently
- [Phase 01-cv-pipeline-storage]: Hardcoded UUID strings in seed SQL (gen_random_uuid() requires DB context; plain INSERT files need literal values)
- [Phase 01-cv-pipeline-storage]: ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING for idempotent seed inserts across games and players dimension tables
- [Phase 01-cv-pipeline-storage]: YOLOv8n pretrained COCO weights without fine-tuning; NBA-specific accuracy deferred to later phases
- [Phase 01-cv-pipeline-storage]: ObjectDetector falls back to yolov8n.pt auto-download if weights_path not found on disk
- [Phase 01-cv-pipeline-storage]: CourtDetector is stateless; designed for periodic calibration (once per game), not per-frame
- [Phase 01-cv-pipeline-storage]: DeepSort returns track_id as str; coerce to int via int(track.track_id) for consistent dict keys in previous_positions
- [Phase 01-cv-pipeline-storage]: Nearest-centroid matching preferred over get_det_class() for object_type — more reliable across DeepSort versions
- [Phase 01-cv-pipeline-storage]: player_id=None for all Phase 1 tracking_coordinates rows — track-to-player mapping deferred to Phase 2
- [Phase 02-feature-engineering]: Shared type contracts as stdlib @dataclass in features/types.py — zero extra dependencies for types module
- [Phase 02-feature-engineering]: Schema extensions in separate features/schema_extensions.sql loaded by init_schema() after base schema — preserves schema-as-SQL pattern
- [Phase 02-feature-engineering]: scipy ConvexHull.volume is 2D area (not .area which is perimeter) — catches silent wrong-value bug
- [Phase 02-feature-engineering]: QhullError imported from scipy.spatial directly — future-proof for scipy 2.0 (deprecated scipy.spatial.qhull removed)
