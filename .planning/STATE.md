## Completed Work

### Phase 1 — Data Infrastructure ✅ (2026-03-12)
- PostgreSQL schema (9 tables, 2 views): `database/schema.sql`
- `src/data/schedule_context.py` — rest days, back-to-back, travel distance
- `src/data/lineup_data.py` — 5-man lineup splits, on/off, game rotation
- `src/data/nba_stats.py` — opponent features
- `src/data/db.py` — PostgreSQL connection helper

### Phase 2 — Tracker Bug Fixes ✅ (2026-03-17)
- Dynamic KMeans team color separation — warm-up 30 frames, recalibrate every 150
- Ball position fallback using possessor 2D coords — EventDetector now fires
- Frozen player eviction — _freeze_age after 20 consecutive frozen frames
- Mean HSV replaces per-crop KMeans — 2fps → ~15fps
- SIFT_INTERVAL=15, SIFT_SCALE=0.5 downscale applied
- 431 tests passing (installed fastapi, python-dotenv, deep-sort-realtime)
- test_tracker.py `__name__ == "__main__"` guard fixed

### Phase 2.5 — CV Tracker Quality Upgrades 🟡 (in progress)
- 025-01 ✅ Broadcast detection mode: `broadcast_mode=True` in config, conf_threshold=0.35 in AdvancedFeetDetector, `count_detections_on_frame()` diagnostic helper
- 025-03 ✅ Test suite: 14 tests for broadcast detection + 3-pass jersey OCR, synthetic images, all green
- 025-04 ✅ `src/tracking/court_detector.py` — detect_court_homography() per-clip M1 from broadcast frames
- 025-05 ✅ unified_pipeline._build_court() wired with per-clip detection + Rectify1.npy fallback (ISSUE-017 closed)
- 025-06 ✅ tests/test_court_detector.py — 7 synthetic tests, all passing

### Phase 5 — External Factors 🟡 (in progress, 2026-03-17)
- `src/data/ref_tracker.py` ✅ — referee tendencies (fouls/game, home win%, pace), `data/nba/ref_tendencies.json` cache
- `src/data/line_monitor.py` ✅ — The Odds API wrapper, sharp signal (opening vs closing), `data/nba/lines_cache.json`
- `src/data/injury_monitor.py` ✅ — ESPN injury report (built prior session), InjuryMonitor class wired into props
- `src/pipeline/unified_pipeline.py` ✅ — PostgreSQL writes added (`_pg_write_tracking_rows`), `game_id` param wired
- `tests/test_phase5.py` ✅ — 18 tests (3 injury, 6 ref, 6 lines, 3 pg_write), 0 failures
- **Pending:** `ref_tracker` real data scrape (needs nba_api officials endpoint), `ODDS_API_KEY` setup for live lines

### Phase 3 — NBA API Data Maximization 🟡 (in progress)
- All 569 players have advanced stats (usg%, TS%, off_rtg, def_rtg, etc.) ✅
- 568/569 player gamelogs scraped ✅ (ISSUE-020 closed — 99.8% done)
- Overall coverage score: 98% avg
- ShotChartDetail: scraper built (`src/data/shot_chart_scraper.py`) — ready to run (ISSUE-019)
- Play-by-play: scraper built (`src/data/pbp_scraper.py`) — ready to run (ISSUE-018)

### ML Models — Trained
- `src/prediction/win_probability.py` — WinProbModel (XGBoost, 27 features, val acc 67.7%)
  - ✅ Retrained 2026-03-17 with sklearn 1.7.2 (ISSUE-016 closed)
- `src/prediction/game_prediction.py` — predict_game(), predict_today()
- `src/prediction/player_props.py` — 7 prop models trained 2026-03-17 ✅
  - PTS MAE=0.32 R²=0.994, REB MAE=0.11 R²=0.995, AST MAE=0.09 R²=0.993
  - FG3M MAE=0.09 R²=0.975, STL MAE=0.07 R²=0.928, BLK MAE=0.05 R²=0.958, TOV MAE=0.08 R²=0.977
- `src/pipeline/model_pipeline.py` — unified train/eval/save
