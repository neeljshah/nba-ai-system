# NBA AI System

An end-to-end NBA analytics and prediction platform: computer vision player tracking → NBA API enrichment → machine learning models → betting edge detection → analytics dashboards → AI chat.

## What This System Does

```
NBA Broadcast Video (.mp4)
    ↓
Computer Vision Tracking Pipeline
    → player positions (2D court), ball location, spacing, possession, events, shot context
    ↓
NBA API Enrichment
    → shot outcomes, possession results, lineups, box scores, schedule, rest, travel
    ↓
PostgreSQL Database
    → all tracking + stats stored, versioned, queryable
    ↓
Machine Learning Models
    → win probability, shot quality, possession outcome, player props, lineup impact
    ↓
Betting Edge Detection
    → model probability vs sportsbook implied probability → flag value bets
    ↓
FastAPI Backend
    → /predictions, /props, /analytics, /betting-edges, /chat
    ↓
Web App (React + Next.js)
    → Betting Dashboard | Analytics Dashboard | AI Chat (Claude API)
```

## Three Final Products

### 1. Betting Dashboard
- Live sportsbook lines (spread, total, moneyline, props) via The Odds API
- Model prediction vs implied probability for every market
- Edge score and star rating (1–3★) per bet
- Best bets panel — highest-edge opportunities ranked automatically
- Historical model accuracy vs closing line

### 2. Analytics Dashboard
- Court heatmaps — shot locations, player movement density
- Win probability chart over all possessions in a game
- Team spacing over time (convex hull area)
- Shot quality by zone — xFG vs actual eFG%
- Lineup performance — any 5-man unit, net rating, spacing score
- Ball movement network — pass map, touch distribution
- Defensive pressure timeline
- Momentum chart — EMA-smoothed scoring run detection

### 3. AI Chat Interface
- Powered by Claude API with tool use calling the backend
- Tools: `get_game_prediction()`, `get_player_props()`, `get_analytics()`, `get_lineup_data()`, `get_betting_edges()`
- Answers questions with real data, not general knowledge
- Examples: *"What lineup should the Celtics use vs zone defense?"* / *"Which props have the most edge tonight?"*

## Data Generated

Each game clip processed produces:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `tracking_data.csv` | Per-frame: player ID, team, 2D position, speed, possession, event, spacing |
| `possessions.csv` | Per-possession: type, duration, spacing, pressure, shot attempted, outcome |
| `shot_log.csv` | Per-shot: who, where, zone, defender distance, spacing, made/missed |
| `features.csv` | 60+ ML-ready engineered features per frame |
| `player_clip_stats.csv` | Per-player aggregates: distance, velocity, possession%, shots, drive rate |
| `shot_quality.csv` | Per-shot quality score (0–1) |
| `momentum.csv` | Per-frame momentum score per team |
| `defense_pressure.csv` | Per-frame defensive pressure score |

**Volume needed for ML:**
- 20 games → shot quality model
- 50 games → possession outcome model
- 100 games → lineup chemistry model
- 200+ games → live win probability LSTM

conda activate basketball_ai
cd nba-ai-system

# Process a game clip end-to-end
python run_clip.py --video game.mp4 --game-id 0022300001 --period 1 --start 0

# Full video with debug overlays
python run.py --frames 100 --debug

# Print tracking quality metrics
python run.py --eval
```

Output is written to `data/`.
